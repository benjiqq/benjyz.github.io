A large part of the formal study of economics is concerned with decisions. [Decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory) was
developed together with mathematical notions of probability theory and games. A conceptual model of 
a decision can be formalised as a set of alternatives and some function or algorithm to select one
of the choices. The canoncial example is a game where all outcomes are clearly defined.

A concept very central in these decision theories is that of utility. While it has some roots in philosophy ([Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism)) it is now mostly used in a reductionist fashion. The assumption is that the entire
world can be abstracted in terms of desirable and undesirable states. All of these states can be 
compared with the utility they lead to for the agent. In effect this reduces any action to a selection 
or optimization algorithm.

Decisions in games have been broadly studied. There are games where the outcomes of players are 
in opposition of each other and games where cooperation is possible. [Mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design) as field recnogizes there is another party which can be studied in games: the designer of a game or judge in a game, i.e. a participant who is not active but sets the rules. Software protocols can be considered as games where participants follow rules. The person who designs the protocol to begin with will consider
the different outcomes depending on what participants do.

Collective decision making has also been studied in relation to games. A large class of decision making
procedures to be studied in Crypto-economics is of course consensus and voting. In collective decision making there
are the decisions themselves and the decision making process. A constitution can define how voting is carried out, 
but the votes themselves happen within that framework. Most structures in society have already been decided on, and
decisions happen inside of these structures, institutions etc. To make meta-decisions is too costly to be carried
out all the time. 

There is the other side of a decision, which is the commitment to a made decision. If a person
decides to be pursue some goal than itself does not signal any likelihood of achieving that goal or even coming
closer to it. Commitment is the re-iteration of a set goal and sacrifice towards it. Decision calculus has the issue
that analysis and action are viewed fundamentally as different, and all of the work is in the analysis, not the 
actual action. It should be clear from introspection that achieving goals also requires work i.e. costly action, not 
just the decision itself. But a commitment to formulated goals has been said to be important to any organisation.

The analysis of decisions in the context of blockchain systems is complicated, in particular the relationship between
incentive and choice. Algorithms can now define monetary payoffs, which is a powerful tool.
