In Bitcoin a cryptographic keypair encodes real value and therefore economic power. It is the first time that information itself by mere proof of its  possession can signal possession and transfer of economic resources directly in software. In all systems before control of any resource is subject to some hierarchy or third party. E.g. a bank credit depends on the institution of the bank and its employees. The accounting ledgers are centrally controlled.

There are fundamentally two types of power: decision making power (DP) and economic power (EP). In a democratic system
DP is acquired by elections or other political processes. EP is acquired by work or capital accumulation. These are situated in fundamentally separate spheres and an overlap is considered problematic. In blockchain systems consensus and incentives are directly linked.

In Proof-of-Work CPU-power gives DP, but not EP - “Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote”. Coins are economic power. Coins don't give decision making power and it can't be acquired directly, but indirectly through mining equipment.

Coins are cryptographic keypairs which give access to a resource, i.e. wealth or economic power (EP). Over time DP became non-evenly distributed with mining centralisation. To what extent more decentralised distribution of coins is an independent question. 
We can observe these two fundamental types of power in Cryptocurrency systems.

[Proof-of-Stake](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.0) was conceived of as early as 2011 and implemented with Peercoin in 2012. 

> I'm wondering if as bitcoins become more widely distributed, whether a transition from a proof of work based system to a proof of stake one might happen.  What I mean by proof of stake is that instead of your "vote" on the accepted transaction history being weighted by the share of computing resources you bring to the network, it's weighted by the number of bitcoins you can prove you own, using your private keys.

In Proof-of-Stake systems coins encode EP and DP, they are one and the same thing. Somebody who holds coins can transfer them in a transaction (EP) and at the same time holding coins grants the holder DP. Decentralisation can either refer to wider distribution of coins (EP) or wider distribution of decision making power (DP). In PoS the two are tighly coupled, which is a reason why PoS systems have been less successful in the marketplace and considered less secure or decentralised. Note the original post already foresaw the issue of vote buying.

>The "voting power" may be more trustworty, since it would accumulate in a bottom-up fashion via a network of trust, instead of in the somewhat arbitrary way it accumulates now.  (Note the potential problem of vote-buying here.)

To what extent it is possible to keep DP and EP separate is an open question. It has been argued that in partcular in Delegated PoS, votes can be bought. In Proof-of-Work this relationship is not as clear. However, it is certainly the case that by itself that in PoS those who hold coins get the DP for free, where as in PoW some economic expense is still required.

If want to achieve more separation of powers we have to be clearly aware of the different types. It is unclear in how far
any separation of powers can be applied. One other decision making power is the authoring of code which is more implicit than explicit,
except for repository access rights.
