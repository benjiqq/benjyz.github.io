In Proof-of-work CPU power is a proxy for decision making power (DMP). “Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.” Coins are cryptographic keypairs which give access to a resource, i.e. wealth or economic power (EP). However over time DMP became non-evenly distributed. Note that DMP is not directly associated with EP. In Proof-of-Stake systems DMP and EP are directly coupled — coins are a direct measure of DMP. This has some interesting consequence, and it seems to me the reason that Proof-of-Stake systems don’t dominate the market is related to this fact. PoS in some sense is not decentralized enough, because of this coupling.

Ideally we want a system where we can reason about DMP and EP independently. This is why in current social structures the political sphere and the economic sphere are kept separate. In fact since the beginning of democracy it was a goal to mitigate dominating influence by a wealthy elite. Ironically in Bitcoin voting and money is directly related — the currency can exist because nodes form consensus and they get economically rewarded for making decisions.

My previous work in the area of blockchain since 2014 has mostly been in the area of markets as a mechanism. This can be expanded to the following consideration: decision making itself can be in certain ways considered to be a crypto-financial asset, i.e. jurisdictions can be seen as franchises (see [1]). Say in a typical election for a parliamentary body every representative, once elected receives a non-fungible uniquely identified token. This token grants the representative access to voting rights in the parliament. It will be revoked after the term has ended. This idea is not entirely new as it has been developed by the Delegated Proof-of-Stake approach, which is a natural extension of PoS (see [2]). However, making it a token in the sense of separate smart contract is new. If this approach succeeds it can have interesting consequences for how to do global consensus.

For now an interesting consequence of these considerations is to more clearly see what the issues with Proof-of-Stake are, and open an avenue for entirely new systems, such that coins and decision making power are more separated. In the authors view merely voting by coins in the style of DPOS does not address these concerns, as the delegates are not uniquely identifiable and there is no reason to vote for one delegate over another.
