Cryptocurrency is money that is issued, we can also say created by or allocated by, by a decentralised computer network.
There is very little to no human involvement when the block creation occurs. Individuals decide to run the Bitcoin software
and we can assume the rest is an automatic process (consensus). 

This is very unlike any other money in history. Proto-money in the form collectibles were simply items which performed functions of money well [1].
Coinage allowed micro transfers secured by the political authority of kings. Banks as institutions allowed to delegate the security of storage of money.
Fiat money and central banking came about by further centralisation of banks and nation states.

The money supply function (MSF) is the function of the supply of money over time, i.e. the amount of money in existence, the
amount of Bitcoins that are owned by some entity/keypair. Money which comes into existence this way by a purely defined software function we call programmatic issuance. 

In Bitcoin the MSF is a approximately a logarthmic function with a total app of 21 million units.

In some systems the amount of money that exists is not the money that in circulation.

Issuance: the act of creating money in software automatically or by discretion. Whether the creation is allowed depends on the consensus i.e.
the rules of the system.

Programmatic issuance: money created by or allocated by a pure software function.

Discretionary issuance: money created by some manual process (a loan, decision by a board of directors etc.)

Positive issuance: Money only ever gets created, not withdrawn or destroyed. This implies the derivative function of MSF is positive at all times.

Capped issuance: the number of units has a total maximum for all time.
