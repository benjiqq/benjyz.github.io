Traditional exchanges mediate transactions by institutions in a private network. They generally don't take custody of funds and the price formation and settlement process are
separated.

Crypto exchanges are very unlike traditional exchanges. The hold custody of funds in a pool, so that 
transactions can happen at high speeds. The first such exchanges were fiat to Bitcoin exchanges. The exchange
would act as a gateway from the banking system to the Bitcoin network.

In some sense Crypto exchanges are like banks, because they are pools of funds. However there is no debt origination in these pools, except for trading leverage. It is important to note that the core Bitcoin protocol
(or any other Cryptocurrency) does not have any parts which are meant to allow these third parties. Bitcoin and by extension Ethereum and others avoid third parties at all costs (decentralisation).

There is the idea of Decentral exchange, which implies that trades are directly settled on a blockchain. 
However currently for all practical purposes all liquidity is in central exchanges.

A crypto exchange can be seen as a node in an economic network. It provides an access point to participate in the marketplace. The access is very direct through the Internet. Other than traditional finance there is an open network over which trades can be submitted and market data received, mostly free of charge.
