This post attempts to lay out a general idea of financial architecture i.e. how the financial system is organised, 
specifically with regards to the structure of the underlying network.

Traditional exchanges mediate transactions by institutions in a private network. They generally don't take custody of funds and the price formation and settlement process are separated. Banks originally provide security of funds, 
but also originate loans based on the deposits they have. Central banks and governments provide security of money
and property. 

From the point of Cryptocurrency these functions are performed partly very poorly. Institutions fail for various reasons, but even more so they are partly unnecessary third parties in transactions.

Crypto exchanges are very unlike traditional exchanges. The hold custody of funds in a pool, so that transactions can happen at high speeds over the public Internet. The first such exchanges were fiat to Bitcoin exchanges. The exchange would act as a gateway from the banking system to the Bitcoin network.

In some sense Crypto exchanges are like banks, because they are pools of funds. However there is no debt origination in these pools, except for trading leverage. It is important to note that the core Bitcoin protocol (or any other Cryptocurrency) does not have any parts which are meant to allow these third parties. Bitcoin and by extension Ethereum and others avoid third parties at all costs (decentralisation). Although Ripple has some fundamental notion of third parties in the sense of the trusted node list, and exchange of value, we consider this as not adequate as it does not incorporate the breakthrough of Bitcoin 
and its Peer-to-Peer system.

The concept of a Decentral exchange comes from the idea that if all assets are tracked on-chain, then the swap of assets can be recorded on the ledger, too. In this case the swap of ownership entails two concurrent transactions which can be both directly settled on a blockchain. However, the difficulty arises to determine the price of this swap, and in a market mechanism there are more than two parties involved. Currently essentially all liquidity is in central exchanges.

A crypto exchange can be seen as a node in an economic network. It provides an access point to participate in the marketplace. The access is very direct through the Internet. Other than traditional finance there is an open network over which trades can be submitted and market data received, both being basically free of charge. The market price formation involves a high number of direct participants, where as traditional exchanges only operate between
a few number of trusting parties (exchange members).

From the perspective of the protocol a deposit transaction is just a regular payment. The depositor retains no rights whatsoever over the deposit. If there are deposit rights they are enforce through the traditional legal process, but not the protocol.
